## Introduction

The Automatic Translation Course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of translation technologies, leveraging popular libraries like **TextBlob**, **goslate**, and **googletrans**. In this course, you will learn how to implement basic to advanced translation functionality in Python.

### Key Features:
- Translate text using external APIs
- Handle language-specific translations
- Integrate translation services into applications
- Work with different translation libraries

## Installation

To get started with the course, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NexusGKSoftwares/automatic-translation-course-udemy.git
   cd automatic-translation-course-udemy
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   If you haven't already, set up a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install additional dependencies** (if required):
   If any other libraries are needed for specific examples, you can install them directly:
   ```bash
   pip install textblob googletrans goslate
   ```

## Usage

To use the translation scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Run a translation script**:
   Each script in this repository is designed to demonstrate a particular feature or translation method. For example, to run the translation example:

   ```bash
   python example3.py
   ```

2. **Edit the scripts**:
   You can modify the script to change the source text or the target language. For example, to translate text to Spanish (`'es'`), simply replace the `to='ar'` argument with `to='es'` in the translation method call.

3. **Create your own translation models**:
   Feel free to explore the scripts and modify them to suit your needs for language translation tasks.

## Project Structure

```bash
automatic-translation-course-udemy/
├── example1.py        # Example of basic translation using TextBlob
├── example2.py        # Example of advanced translation with goslate
├── example3.py        # Example using googletrans API
├── requirements.txt   # List of required dependencies
├── translate_script.py  # Main script for custom translations
└── venv/              # Virtual environment directory (don't push to GitHub)
```

- `example1.py` - A basic translation example using the **TextBlob** library.
- `example2.py` - A more advanced example using the **goslate** package.
- `example3.py` - A script that uses the **googletrans** library for translations.
- `requirements.txt` - Lists all the required Python libraries for the project.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries:

- **textblob**: Provides simple APIs for text processing, including language translation.
- **goslate**: A Python wrapper for Google Translate.
- **googletrans**: A Python API wrapper for Google Translate.
- **futures**: A compatibility library to handle concurrent futures.

To install all dependencies, simply run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
